            "explanations": {
                "a": "The maximum stress at which materials fail for a specified number of cycles is fatigue strength. Many materials exhibit a limiting stress value. Below this, it can be operated for an indefinitely large number of cycles.",
                "b": "Fatigue life is a mechanical term that relates to how long an object or material will last before completely failing because of concentrated stresses.",
                "c": "Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking.",
                "d": "The endurance limit (Se) of a material is defined as the stress below which a material can endure an infinite number of repeated load cycles without exhibiting failure."
