**Procedure**

1. Take the specimen in circular shape.
2. Take the required dimensions of circular rod.
3. A specimen is placed in the machine and a force is applied via a bending moment using
weights hung off the sample.
4. The force induces a surface stress that will be tensile on one side of the sample (generally
the top) and compressive on the opposite side.
5. When the test is started, the sample will rotate at the desired rate and this rotation will
cause the surfaces to interchange so that each surface experiences alternating tensile and
compressive stresses.
6. The sample is left in the machine until failure at which point ADMETâ€™s eP2 controller will
display the number of cycles it took for the sample to fail.
7. Finally take the readings.


**Virtual Procedure**
1. Start the Experiment by clicking the play button.
2. Observe the elongation and compression of the test specimen in the simulation window.
3. As the simulation continues, the different values of force, stress and number of cycles are observed.
4. A graph is plotted between the log(Stress) and log(Number of Cycles).
5. The Experiment allows you to pause/play/restart the simulation to view the values of different parameters at every stage of simulation.

NOTE: There are various features available for the graphs such as zoom, etc. The function/feature of each icon above the graphs becomes visible upon hovering over the concerned icon.
