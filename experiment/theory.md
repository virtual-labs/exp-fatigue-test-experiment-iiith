- When a material is subjected to repeated stresses, it fails at stresses below the yield point.
Such type of failure of a material is known as fatigue. The failure is caused by means of a
progressive crack formation which are usually fine and of microscopic size. The failure may occur
even without any prior indication. The fatigue of material is affected by the size of the component,
relative magnitude of static and fluctuating loads and the number of load reversals.
